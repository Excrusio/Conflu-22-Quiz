This manga initially had the name 'Snipe' but since then, the author decided to change the main weapon of most characters hence the name Snipe wouldn't be appropriate. Most of the characters were associated with a colour which is quite common hence he decided to name the manga with its complementary colour. The author also was a fan of Nirvana, whose first album also shared the same name. The series also has a movie adaption whose english adaptation shares name with a Metallica song relating to the colour. ID X. Bonus for song.
