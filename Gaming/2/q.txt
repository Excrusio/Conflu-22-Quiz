Corsola, introduced in Pokemon as part of the 2nd generation, has the standard form of a cheerful, pinkish small Pokemon. In its regional form of Galarian Corsola, it switches its type from rock/water type to ghost type and also takes a cursed, forlorn, white and frowning demeanour. The Galarian form is supposedly a depiction of real life world events from the region Corsola hails from. 
To take things further, Galarian Corsola evolves into Cursola which resembles an even more terrifying skeletal tree of ___.
