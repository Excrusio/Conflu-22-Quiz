Shown in the picture is a native American collecting bugs from a cactus plant. The bugs were highly sought as was a source of financial backbone of the Spanish Empire for nearly two centuries and became the second most valuable export next to silver in European markets. The demand was due to a pigment (used for fabric dyeing) they produce which was unmatched in brilliance and longevity. The pigment is also used in food colouring. ID the bug and the pigment.
