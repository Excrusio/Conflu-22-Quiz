X is a phenomenon that occurs when individuals believe that personality descriptions apply specifically to them (more so than to other people),  yet which are in fact vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people. This effect provides a little explanation for the widespread beliefs of astrology, fortune telling, aura reading etc. X is named after one of the greatest American showman Y's aphorism, "A circus should
have a little something for everyone".
