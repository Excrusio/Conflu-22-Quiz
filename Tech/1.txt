X is a pun on the common copyright disclaimer "All rights reserved”. It is a phrase that indicates a release of copyright. It was first used by author Gregory Hill to authorize the free reprinting of his Principia Discordia in the late 1960s. 
It would later go on to inspire the Y symbol and licensing status. Richard Stallman, one of the earliest proponents of the Free Software Movement, chose the phrase to identify his method of distribution. It is often accompanied by a reversed version of the copyright symbol.
