In 1981, David Bradley of IBM created a shortcut that triggered a system reset. When the shortcut eventually reached Microsoft Windows, it proved to be quite an useful tool for fixing the 'Blue Screen of Death'. Although Bill Gates would have preferred a simpler shortcut, X was a saving grace for PC owners and was dubbed as the 'three finger salute'. To quote Bradley, "I may have invented X, but Bill Gates made it famous".
