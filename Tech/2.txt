Named after prominent mathematician ____ _____ (X), the X number is a colloquial metric used to describe the collaborative distance between the mathematician X and another person, as measured by authorship of mathematical papers. The idea of the X number was originally created by the mathematician's friends as a tribute to his enormous output. Later it gained prominence as a tool to study how mathematicians cooperate to find answers to unsolved problems.
Even outside the field of mathematics, prolific researchers tend to have low X numbers. For example, these are some Nobel Laureates and their X numbers:
1. Einstein: 2
2. John Nash: 3
3. Richard Feynman: 3

Even Angela Merkel has an X number of 5
