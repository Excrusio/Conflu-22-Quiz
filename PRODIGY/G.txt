X mother, Vinata, mother of the birds, was tricked into becoming the slave of her sister and co-wife, Kadru, mother of the nagas (serpents). The lasting enmity between the birds, particularly X, and the serpents is attributed to this. The serpents agreed to release X's mother if X could obtain (and he did) Amrita which gave the serpents the ability to shed off their skin. X was succesfully able to do so and on his way back, agreed to serve a prominent figure in Hindu mythology as a mount.
