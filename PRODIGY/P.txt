In early Europe, X was white gold, valued both for its durability and its delicacy and also priced for its exotic origins. It was first brought to Europe from China by Marco Polo in the 14th century. Europeans tried to manufacture X locally instead of importing it since it was so costly, but only failed to uncover the mysteries of its craft. Jingdezhen, China is named the X capital of the world.

X is used as a tableware, decorative objects, lab equipment and electrical insulator as well. Identify X.
