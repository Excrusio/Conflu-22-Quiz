Myrddin Wyllt is a figure in medieval Welsh legend who is accounted a chief bard, the speaker of several poems in The Black Book of Carmarthen.
Myrddin's legend is rooted in history, for he is said to have gone mad after the Battle of Arfderydd at Arthuret, fled into the forest, lived with the beasts and received the gift of prophecy.
The modern depiction of X began with Geoffrey of Monmouth, who portrayed him as a prophet and a madman. Further developments of the legend have been done by T. H. White in his book The Once and Future King, which has inspired and shaped many modern magic systems, and also been used to succesfully adapt the legend into a successful TV series.
