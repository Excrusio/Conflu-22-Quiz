X in Sanskrit implies the ‘Remainder’ that which remains when all ceases to exist and plays a pivotal role in the continuation of the universe. X is also sometimes referred to as ‘Endless X’ or simply ‘Endless’. It is said that X has had four avatars (incarnations) on Earth. All the avatars of X were closely related to and occurred when another divine entity Y has had an avatar (incarnation) on Earth. X’s brother Z also played an important role in one of the best-known Hindu myths of Samudra Manthan. Identify X, Y, Z.
