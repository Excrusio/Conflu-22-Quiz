It comes from the medieval Italian Words "__" meaning bad and "__" meaning air - so it literally means "bad air". The term was used to describe the unpleasant air emanating from the marshland surrounding Rome, which was believed to cause the  __ we now call X (and we now know that it's the __ breeding in these conditions that cause X, rather than the air itself).
