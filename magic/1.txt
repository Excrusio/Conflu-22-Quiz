Inspired by the open-endedness of Dungeons and Dragons, but irked by it being "dreadfully written", Richard Garfield developed his own game called Five Magics which he continued to refine as he grew up. As a PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania, Garfield developed his ideas and approached a friend of a friend to publish one of his games, RoboRally, via his newly founded company Wizards of the Coast.
While he was impressed by the idea of RoboRally, he deemed it too risky and complicated to publish and instead told Garfield he wanted something simpler which could be played between games of DnD at gaming conventions. After contemplating his advice, Garfield decided to take the concept of Five Magiccs and apply it to collectible color themed cards to create a game that would go on to shape the world of fantasy gaming.
