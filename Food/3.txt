_____ Alexandrovna of Russia married Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, the second son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and became Duchess of Edinburgh and Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.
From 1893 until her death, she had the distinction of being a Russian grand duchess (by birth), a British royal duchess (by marriage), and the consort (and later widow) of a German sovereign duke.
A snack was prepared for her wedding to the Prince and named after her, which has now become a household name.
