In 1981, X, a brand of non-shelf-stable was introduced by Golden Valley Foods, with the uncooked product requiring refrigeration before use since the fats used in it would turn rancid if it wasn't kept chilled. However, in 1984, Golden Valley introduced a shelf-stable version Y that could be cooked straight out of the packet, and since this product was a sequel of sorts to X, it was named accordingly.
